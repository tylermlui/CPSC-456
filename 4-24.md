## Firewall Fundamentals

- Firewall filters out packets from your network. The network has a set of rules that will block certain packets.
- If there is a packet that matches the rule, then it will block the packet.
- This is the chokepoint for the network, as it should be the main area that protects the network
- You can filter out packets from different countries, areas, etc.

### Firewall Limitations
- Cannot protect against attacks that are past the firewall
- Physical attacks, or attacks within the network
- Cannot prevent attacks that happen in the application specific vulnerabilities
- There is no way for it to know if the user has authentication on the application level

### Types of firewalls
- Packet Filtering Firewall: Will apply a set of rules to each packet based on the headers of the packet
- Default deny: It will deny them automatically  ***unless** they have authorization.

### Stateful Firewalls
- Keeps track of TCP Sequence to determine if it needs to drop a packet
- Prevents Session Hijacking

### Application Level Gateways
- More secure than packet filtering (It takes an extra step to fool the firewall)

**Limitations:** Increased overhead since you will need to make two TCP connections


### The Demilitarized Zone
- Separates organization's internal network from the external network.
- This uses two firewalls. It is better to use different firewalls from different companies.
