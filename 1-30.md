Static IP Assignment: 

>[!NOTE]
>How does a host get IP address?
> Static approach: The system is manually configured to use a specific IP

DHCP: allows host to dymanically obtainits IP address from network server when it joins the network

DHCP Overview (DORA):
- The router needs to find and address that is available and will send it to the host.

### DHCP client-server scenario

- D (Discover)
  - When the arriving client arrives the src. is 0.0.0.0.68 because it does not have an address

- O (Offer)
  - The server will offer an adddress

- R (Request)
  - The client will then request the server again with the given address

- A (Acknoqlege)
  - The server will give the client access for a set amount of time, before it takes the address back.
 
### DHCP: More than IP address 
- Can return more than just allocatted IP address on subnet:
  - address of first-hop router for client
  - name and IP address of DNS server
  - network mask (indicating network versus host poriton of address)
- Before you route to other addresses, you need to go through the gateway first for security reasons.

That is why it will give you the first-hop?

### Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA)

- APIPA address is chosen when DHCP is enabled

### Basic Routing Concepts: Longest Prefix Match Routing

- Basic Idea: when a router receives a packet, it compares the prefix.  

- The narrower the better, so we want to find the longest matching prefix.  

$`2^32 - 24 = 2^8 = 256`$ Possible addresses  
$`2^32 - 27 = 2^5 = 32`$ Possible addresses  
$`2^32 - 29 = 2^3 = 8`$ Possible addresses <- This is the best as it has the least amount of possible addresses, thus the router can narrow it down more.
