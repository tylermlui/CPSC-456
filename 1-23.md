## The Internet Infrastructure

- Network Edge: End-Systems(servers,PC's,etc.) and applications that rely on the internet services

- Network Core: Networks of routers inter-connecting the end-systems
    - Internet Service Provider Networks: connect end-systems to the Internet
    - Backbone: networks which route data between ISP networks
    - Local Area Networks: network interconnecting systems within a limited range

### Dominant Protocols on the Internet

Local area netowrks(LANs): 
- 802.3: Wired Ethernet
- 802.11: Wireless Ethernet

Internet:
- Domain Name Service (DNS): Resolves domain names to IP addresses.
- Open Shortest Path First(OSPF): Routes traffic within internet netowrk. This is considered "Interdomain".
- Border Gateway Protocol(BGF) Intradomain

### Threat model
A threat model is a structured representation of all the information that affects the security.  

Threats:
- Malicious end systems: systems affected by maleware or used by attackers. ( We want to cut these systems out of the network to minimize harm.)
- Compromised router and link: Tapped link, backed routers, etc. The Edge can be eaffected or the router itself.
- Malicious ISPs and Backbone Networks. (Threat level is very high as the backbone and ISP are affected.)

## Networking

A network is simply a collection of computers or other hardware devices (aka. hosts) using hardware and software that allows the devices to exchange information and cooperate.  

Networking is the process of designing, implementing, upgrading, managing and working with the networks and network technology.  


### Benefits of Networking

#### Advantages:
- Data Sharing (Won't need to physically be there to share files)
- Hardware/ Sharing Internet Access: Allows devices and connections to share the bandwidth.
- Data Security and Management: Centralize data on shared servers
- Performance Enhancement and Balancing: Distributing computational tasks to various nodes on the network

#### Disadvantages: 
- Additional overhead cost: cost for getting these devices, configuring the software for the devices, and administration cost for maintenance and management.
- Undesirable Sharing: Malware can be transferred within the network by bad actors.
- Data Security Concerns: Poorly secured networks can put data at risk.

### OSI model and TCP/IP Model

#### Layers
Each layer implements a service. This allows for modularity within the system design. If there are any errors within the system, you can take layers off, one by one to see which one is giving the issue.  

This modularity allows for ease of maintenance and updates to the system.

Message -> then added the port information -> IP address is added -> MAC address is added -> Physical Layer

### OSI 

With OSI you have presentation which encrypts and session which allows for checkpointing whicha llows for recovery of data. These layers are missing in TCP/IP as TCP/IP does not need encryption.


## Network Standards
- Local Area Network (LAN)

- Campus Area Network (CAN)

- Wide Area Network (WAN)

### Layer 1 Devices
- Ethernet Hub:
    - No knowledge of addresses ( will duplicate information to every device on the network)
    - One way traffic(half duplex)
- Ethernet Repeater: This is a signal extender
- Network interface Card

### Layer 2 Device
- Ethernet Switch:
    - Both devices can send data simultaneously (full duplex).
    - Switches route the data within the network.
    - Has MAC addresses to forward traffic to specific ports.
- Ethernet Bridge:
    - Segment a network into multiple collision domains ( replaced by switches)

### Layer 3 Device
- Ethernet Router:
    - Referred to as a gateway.
    - Routers send data between different networks.
    - Forwards traffic to another network until it reaches the destination network.
    - These will deal with packets sent by other networks.
- Router Firewall:
    - Works as a packet filter router.
    - Forwards traffic to another network until it reaches the destination network.
    - This will allow or deny incoming or outgoing traffic.

## Transmission modes

- Simplex: One-way communication

- Half Duplex: Two-way communication, but only one at a time

- Full duplex: Two-way communication, both at the same time


## Network Topology

Refers to how various nodes, devices, and their connections are physically or logically arranged in relation to each other.

### Bus Topology

Bus topology connects all the devices on a single shared channel. Called a "line or backbone topology"

### Ring Topology

A ring topology connects all the devices in a circle (or a ring). the data can travel through the ring in either one direction for single ring or both directions in dual ring.

Pros:
- with ring topology, there is no packet collision 
- easy node configuration

Cons: 
- Only one node can send data at a time.
- Failure of one node can bring down the entire network
- Failure in one connection can bring down the network
- You must interrupt the network to add/remove a network device


### Star Topology

A star topology is laid out so that every node is connected to a central hub (central manager) kind of like a middleman. So if any node is disrupted or fails then the other nodes on the network will still work.

Pros: 
- Other nodes can be added without disruption. It is very cost-effective

Cons:
- If the central device goes down, then the whole network will go down. 


### Mesh Topology

This is a point-to-point structure, which allows for all the devices to be connected directly to every other device on the network.

Pros: 
- There is a lot of redundancy and link recovery
- Provides more fault tolerance when one or more links fail but will not bring down the network
- Very Reliable

Cons:
- It is very complex, which makes it very hard to troubleshoot
- The costs of resources are much higher.
- Very labor-intensive
- Each link has to be protected with a firewall or the whole network is at risk if that node is compromised.

## How Network Devices are Used
Router (Operates on Layer 3)
- Physical: star topology  
- Logical: mesh topology  

Ethernet Switch (Operates on Layer 2)
- Physical and Logical: Star Topology

Ethernet Hub - Broadcasts packets to all connected devices (Operates on Layer 1)
- Physical: Star Topology
- Logical: Bus Topology

Wireless Access Point - Connects two network segments (Operates on Layer 2)
- Physical and Logical: Star Topology
