## Summary of Lecture 1

Topologies:

**Bus topology:** Uses a single one-way channel to send data through. The weakness is that there is a single point of failure.
**Ring topology:** This uses a one-directional/two-directional channel that connects nodes to one another. The weakness is that if one node fails, then the whole network fails.
**Mesh topology:** This connects all of the nodes together each with a link to all other nodes, it is decentralized and does not have a "middleman". It allows to add and remove nodes without disrupting the system. There are not real weaknesses besides that it is very complicated to setup.
**Star topology:** This connects all the nodes in the netowrk to one central hub. Allowing for the removal and addition of nodes seamlessly. The weakness is the central hub.

# Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4)

IP Datagram Format: Contains IP addresses. 

IP address: 32-bit identifier associated with each host or router interface.
- Each 8 bits(octet) must add up to the dotted-decimal IP address notation

### Subnet

Devices that can physically reach each other without going through an intervening router.  

- IP addresses have structure:
  - subnet part: devices in the same subnet have common high order bits
  - host part: remaining low order bits.


Each isolated network is called a subnet.  
- These isolated netorks can have their own policies
When sending packets between subnet "islands" you will have to send it to the host router then the host router will send it from there.  

Submnet masks:
- The number of bits you want to lock in will be specified at the end with
` /{amount to block}`  
- When you specify a subnet with a /24 at the end, that means you lock the first 24 bits in. Meaning that only the last octet of a 32-bit IP address will change.  
>[!WARNING]
>Why would we need to do this? Would they change if you did not mask the subnet?


## Classful Addressing

### Disadvangages:
- Inefficient IP Address Utilization
- Not very flexible

## CIDR Classless InterDomain Routing

Splits the IP address into two sections: The first specifies the network subnet address and the second address of the host on the network.

Subnet portion of address of arbitrary length
Address format: a.b.c.d/x, where x is # of bits in subnet portion of address.
1. Dotted Decimal: 192.168.1.0
2. Binary: 11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000
3. CIDR: 255.255.192.0

Subnetting with CIDR
Subnetting is the process to subdivide a network into multiple subnetowrks(subnets) by borrowing subnet mask host bits to be turned into network bits.
Ex: if we need to divide a subnet into x amount of subnetworks we need to take the exponent form of x. If x is 4 and the subnet mask is 16 then we need to take the 2 from 2^2 and then add it to the subnet mask which would be 18. We then can use those 2 bits for our subnetworks.

Total subnets = 2^b (where b > 0 refers to the borrowed host bits starting from the left most bit.)

>[!WARNING]
> Why would be divide it by 2 when we only borrow one bit?


Exercise: 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c11ed37e-3419-416b-8655-61f3a5733535)


Answer:  
Subnet Mask Prefix Conversion: /16  
Total Subnets: 2^2 = 4.  
After borrowing the new subnet the subnet mask is /18 for both subnets.  
Size_per_Subnet = 2^32 - 2^18 = 2^14 = 16384  
16384 / 256 = 64  
Subnets Created: 192.168.0.0 , 192.168.64.0 , 192.168.128.0 , 192.168.192.0
