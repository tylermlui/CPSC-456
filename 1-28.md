# CPSC 456 1/18/2025 - Lecture 2

## Summary of Lecture 1

### Topologies:
- **Bus topology:** Uses a single one-way channel to send data through. The weakness is that there is a single point of failure.  
- **Ring topology:** This uses a one-directional/two-directional channel that connects nodes to one another. The weakness is that if one node fails, then the whole network fails.  
- **Mesh topology:** This connects all of the nodes together each with a link to all other nodes, it is decentralized and does not have a "middleman". It allows to add and remove nodes without disrupting the system. There are not real weaknesses besides that it is very complicated to setup.  
- **Star topology:** This connects all the nodes in the netowrk to one central hub. Allowing for the removal and addition of nodes seamlessly. The weakness is the central hub.

# Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4)

### IP Datagram Format

### IP address: 
- 32-bit identifier associated with each host or router interface.
- Each 8 bits(octet) must add up to the dotted-decimal IP address notation

### Interface: 
- connection between host/ router and physical link
- routers have multiple interfaces (They have multiple devices that they are connnected to / can be connected to. They have multiple ports for ethernet connections).
- hosts typically have one or two interfaces which they connect with the routers (Either connected to the routers using ethernet or wireless connection)

### Subnet
Devices that can physically reach each other without going through an intervening router.  

- IP addresses have structure:
  - subnet part: devices in the same subnet have common high order bits
  - host part: remaining low order bits.

**To define a subnet:**
- We detach each interface from its host or router, creating islands of isolated interfaces. 
- Each isolated network is called a subnet.  
- These isolated netorks can have their own policies and can be managed independently
  
- When sending packets between subnet "islands" you will have to send it to the host/ router then the host/router will send it from there.  

### Submnet masks:
- The number of bits you want to lock in will be specified at the end with: 
` /{amount to block by}`  
- When you specify a subnet on a 32-bit IP address with a /24 at the end, that means you lock the first 24 bits in. Meaning that only the last octet of a 32-bit IP address will change.  
>[!WARNING]
>Why would we need to do this? Would they change if you did not use a subnet mask?<br><br>
>- We need to do this because when other routers pass packets to the host, they need to know where to send them. When they are given the IP address, they will not know what the **Network** vs. **Host** address will be.  
>- For example: If we have the IP address of 192.168.123.132, without the subnet mask the Network vs. Host address would not be known by the router that is passing the packet.  
>- Since the network address could be "192.168.1."?, "192.168"?, "192.168.12."?,.,.,.... Who knows? When does the host address start? ".123.132"?, "23.132"?, ".132"?.... Who knows? *This* is why we use a subnet mask.  
>- The network mask will then tell us the difference between the two. If the subnet mask is: 255.255.255.0 and the IP addres is: 192.168.123.132 then we know the network address is 192.168.123.0 and the Host address is 0.0.0.132
>- If we show this in Binary it will give us a better picture:  
> 11000000.10101000.01111011.10000100 - IP address (192.168.123.132)  
> 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 - Subnet mask (255.255.255.0)
> - We will then be able to get the two addresses from here:  
> 11000000.10101000.01111011.00000000 - Network address (192.168.123.0)  
> 00000000.00000000.00000000.10000100 - Host address (000.000.000.132)  

## Classful Addressing
- Class A: **0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255**, with a default subnet mask of 255.0.0.0
  - Supports a large number of hosts per network (128 networks x ~16 million host per network)
- Class B: **128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255**, with a default subnet mask of 255.255.0.0
  - Supports medium sized networks (16384 networks x ~65,000 hosts per network)
  - The number of network addresses is 16384 because we use the subnet mask to get the total number of network addresses which give us:
  - 191.255. - 128.0. = 63.255. which then we can multiply the two together to get the total number or addresses: 63 x 255 = 16065
  - The number of host addresses is 65,000 because we use the rest of the address from the masked IP address which gives us:
  - 0.0.255.255 we can then multiply this 255 x 255 which then gives us 65,025 host addresses
- Class C: **192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255**, with a default subnet mask of 255.255.255.0
  - Supports smaller sized networks (2,097,152 networks x 254 hosts per netowrk)
- Class D: **224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255**
  - Reserved for multicast groups
- Class E: **240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255**
  - Reserved for experimental purposes and future use
  
### Disadvangages:
- Inefficient IP Address Utilization
- Not very flexible you cannot tailor subnet sizes to specific network needs
  - Difficult to allocate IP addresses as network grows.
- Increased Routing Table Size, which results in larger routing tables which increases complexity.

## CIDR Classless InterDomain Routing
### Subnetting with CIDR 
Subnetting: Splits the IP address into two sections: The first specifies the network subnet address and the second address of the host on the network.  

Subnetting is the process to subdivide a network into multiple subnetowrks(subnets) by borrowing subnet mask host bits to be turned into network bits.  

Ex: if we need to divide a subnet into x amount of subnetworks we need to take the exponent form of x. If x is 4 and the subnet mask is 16 then we need to take the 2 from 2^2 and then add it to the subnet mask which would be 18. We then can use those 2 bits for our subnetworks.  

- Total subnets: $$2^{b}$$ (Where b > 0 refers to the borrowed host bits starting from the lest most bit)
- Size per subnet: $$2^{h}$$ (Where h refers to the total remaining host bits)
- Block size: $$2^{r}$$ (Where r refers to the number of remaining host bits of the subdivided octet)
- Available hosts per subnet: Size per subnet - 2 (Because every network there are two reserved addresses) 


Subnet portion of address of arbitrary length
Address format: a.b.c.d/x, where x is # of bits in subnet portion of address.
1. Dotted Decimal: 192.168.1.0
2. Binary: 11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000
3. CIDR: 255.255.192.0

>[!WARNING]
> Why would be divide it by 2 when we only borrow one bit? <br> <br>
> - Given the example we have the address 192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0.  
> - From this we want to create 4 subnets.
> - We will convert this subnet mask into prefix: 255.255.0.0 = 16 this is because 1111111.1111111.0.0 is 16 bits.
> - From this we want to get 4 subnets. But since we have the mask we need to take from the host bits and add them to the network bits to create the subnetworks.
> - By taking bits from the host bits, it gives us space for these subnets.
> - So, if we have the address 192.168.0.0 it converts to 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000000 in binary. The bits that are masked range from 11000000.10101000.
> - Thus we can then borrow more bits to get that subnet so since we need to create 4 subnets, we borrow 2 bits because $$2^{2}$$ = 4 since 2 bits give us 4 combinations.
> - 11000000.10101000.00 will now give us 4 combinations: "11000000.10101000.00", "11000000.10101000.01", "11000000.10101000.10", "11000000.10101000.11". So now the subnet mask is 18 because the extra 2 bits are now apart of the network address and not the host address since we borrowed them.
> - We can see the size of the subnet by $$2^{h}$$ = $$2^{32-18}$$ = $$2^{14}$$ = 16385 per subnet. This would be this portion of each address:  
> 11000000 10101000 00[000000 00000000]    
> 11000000 10101000 01[000000 00000000]  
> 11000000 10101000 10[000000 00000000]  
> 11000000 10101000 11[000000 00000000]

Exercise: 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c11ed37e-3419-416b-8655-61f3a5733535)


Answer:  
Subnet Mask Prefix Conversion: /16  
Total Subnets: 2^2 = 4.  
After borrowing the new subnet the subnet mask is /18 for both subnets.  
Size_per_Subnet = 2^32 - 2^18 = 2^14 = 16384  
16384 / 256 = 64  
Subnets Created: 192.168.0.0 , 192.168.64.0 , 192.168.128.0 , 192.168.192.0
