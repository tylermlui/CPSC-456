## CAM Table

Switch 1 CAM Table

MAC_A - 2
MAC_B - 3
MAC_C - 4

When assigning the ports from switches that are outside of the switch that we are on, we assign the port of those outside Mac-addresses as the port that they are going through. 


## Dynamic Routing Protocols

Dynamic Routing will recalcuate the path based on ceratain conditions.

The administrative distance is the decision it will make for what routing algorithm it wants to use.



When two computers are connected together through a link there is an Administrative Distance of 0. 

When you statically set the routing the Administrative Distance is 1. It will give priority to a statically set route.


The reason RIP is not the highest priority, is because it uses a greedy algorithm and tries to find the lowest number of hops possible, and is based on neighbors. The distance vector is linked to the number of hops. 
It is limited to 15 number of hops.

RIP will not take into consideration the speed of these links, and will only look for the shortest path. 

### OSPF
Link state protocol: It will save the information in a link state database(LSDB).

The goal of OSPF is to be able to determine a complete map of the whole network, all the routers, all the links, all the speed of the links, etc.

How does OSPF create a mpa of the entire network? 
It will talk to each neighbor and will exchange information that they have. It will exchange it's LSDB with the other routers, it can then find the best possible path from there.


Once you obtain a Router ID, it will send a "Hello" packet to the router2 which gives its information of their Area ID, neighbours, etc. 

Once it authenticates that the information is correct, it will send it's information back to the router, with all of it's neighbors. 

We need to elect a designated router, to tell the rest of the routers about information about each other, so these routers do not have to continue to update each other. We then need to elect a backup designated router. 

If a certain router goes down, then the designated router will be informed and the rest of the routers will ignore this information.

When choosing the best routes, we need to consider the bandwith and we can calculate the bandwidth for the whole path, to find the best path based on this.
