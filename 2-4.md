## Supernet Examples

### 1. Consider Subnets: 10.0.0.0/24, 10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24, 10.0.3.0/24 Merge them into a single subnet

00001010.00000000.00000000.00000000  
00001010.00000000.00000001.00000000  
00001010.00000000.00000010.00000000  
00001010.00000000.00000011.00000000  

The common prefix is:  
00001010.00000000.000000  

Now add 00.00000000 to the end:  
00001010.00000000.00000000.00000000  

The subnet is now:  
10.0.0.0/22


### 2. Consider the subnets: 176.16.0.0/20, 176.16.16.0/20, 176.16.24.0/20, 176.16.32.0/20 Merge them into a single subnet  

10110000.00010000.00000000.00000000  
10110000.00010000.00010000.00000000  
10110000.00010000.00011000.00000000  
10110000.00010000.00100000.00000000

The common prefix is:  
10110000.00010000.00  

Now add 000000.00000000 to the end:  
10110000.00010000.00000000.00000000  

The subnet is now:  
176.16.0.0/18 

### 3. Consider the subnets: 203.0.113.0/25 and 203.0.113.128/25 Merge them into a single subnet

011001011.00000000.01110001.00000000  
011001011.00000000.01110001.10000000  

The common prefix is:  
011001011.00000000.01110001

Now add .00000000 to the end:  
011001011.00000000.01110001.00000000

The subnet is now:  
203.0.113.0/24


Hierarchical addressing allows efficient advertisement of routing information:  

If there are ISPs that have identical advertisement addresses, the packet will go with the one that has the longest common prefix.

### NAT: Network address translation

- Range of addresses not needed from ISP: just one IP address for all devices
- Can change addresses of devices in local network without notifying outside world
- Can change ISP without changing addresses of devices in local network
- Devices inside local net not explicitly addressable, visible by outside world (a security plus)
- If you want to change your ISP but not your public IP, then you can buy the IP so you will not need to change the addresses of devices within your local network

- Uses a translation table to assign the local devices a public address. It will send out the packets using this public address as the sender. 

- 60,000 connections that can connect with a single LAN-side address, while keeping just one public address.


### NAT traversal problem 

Solution 2: Uses lease times for ports

Solution 3: Relaying:  
- The relay must have a public IP address
- This relay bridges packets between 2 connections

### ICMP 
Used by hosts and routers to communicate network level information 

### Traceroute and ICMP
This helps you tell which router is down through the links of routers

This will send probes that increment as it gets to the next link. Once you get a drop you can tell based on the Time To Live, and how many probes it sent.
